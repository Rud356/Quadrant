# asyncio_chat
This is my try to create some chat app server using Quart and Mongodb  
There's some problems like delivering updates of nicknames and lack of functionallity yet, but you may help me fix it or I'll fix it some time soon  

Yet to add:
- [ ] Group DMs
- [ ] Voice calls
- [ ] Servers, roles, emojis, etc.
- [x] Updates notification
- [ ] Better files uploading
- [ ] Optmizate logging in
- [x] Add autocleaner of inactive users
- [x] Add some users updates notification system
